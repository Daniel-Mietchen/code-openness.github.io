## Data context
So that the other groups do not have to deal with the data set in detail, our main goal has been to make the bibliographic data from the PIK accessible. 
This means that the dataset must be in reasonably good quality and compatible with the data model of Wikidata before we can give the dataset to the next group.

The complete documentation can be found at  [Dokumentation: Data Cleansing and Model](https://github.com/code-openness/Documentation/wiki/Data-Model)

### Challenges: 
Our first challenge was to fully understand the data set. Some types were unclear and the correct formatting of the CSV file had to be respected. We quickly realized that there were some inconsistencies in the dataset and that we needed to fix them as best we could in order to continue working with the data. 
We also had to consider a data model that fits both Wikidata and the Scholia concept. After the cleanup and the creation of the data model, the last challenge was to get the current data set into the created data model. 


### Results: 
As results we can now show a cleaned up dataset and the scripts to clean up a dataset.  In addition a list with requirements to the following data sets, in order to guarantee the quality already with the production of such data sets. 
Furthermore, a model was created that fits into the format of Wikidata and Scholia.
