# Open Climate Library

## Code Openness Project
The code-opennes project is part of the [Coding Openness Software Project](https://www.mi.fu-berlin.de/en/inf/groups/hcc/teaching/summer_term_2019/coding-openness.html) led by [Prof. Müller-Birn](https://www.clmb.de/index.html) and her Research Group, [Human-Centered Computing](https://www.mi.fu-berlin.de/en/inf/groups/hcc/index.html), at the Freie Universität Berlin, in cooperation with the Potsdam Institute for Climate ([PIK](https://www.pik-potsdam.de/pik-frontpage)).

## The project
In this project, we got a dataset containing bibliographic information of a scientific library for climate science. This dataset contained about 8,000 entries and was to be transferred to Wikidata format for further processing and analysis. The potential of Wikidata and Wikimedia software as a source and tool environment for data analysis should, therefore, be investigated. The data set should then be visualized from Wikidata with the data visualization tool "Scholia". Therefore, the project aimed to make the bibliographic data of the Climate Research Institute available in an independent Wikibase environment via the GUI and the Query Service and then to visualize them using Scholia. 
The whole group was divided into three subgroups: Data context, data mapping, and data visualization. 
The connection between the three groups is as follows:

Because the project is based on Free/Libre Open Source software, all software has been kept open source, for example, communication has been managed via open source software. All code is written and used during the project can be found on the GitHub page.
